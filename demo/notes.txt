simulator ideas: [04/12/2021]
Use optparse not within the simulator, but in the script that calls the simulator
(https://www.r-bloggers.com/2015/09/passing-arguments-to-an-r-script-from-command-lines/)

- use future_lapply
- check the random number generation after
- allow shuffling of the order of which paramMat's are run (this isn't too hard -- just shuffle and reshuffle back at the end)
- automatically append the elapsed time
- make a scheduler (trial and row) that the simulator loops trhough

suggestion from https://rstudio.github.io/promises/articles/futures.html
- use multisession
- explicitly load the variables and packages into the child processes
- how to handle scenario where the inner function uses parallelization also...? see https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/future/vignettes/future-3-topologies.html
